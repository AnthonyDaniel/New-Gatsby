This plugin’s available as npm package <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weknow/reaction-payment-skeleton\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weknow/reaction-payment-skeleton</a> or in GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-skeleton\">reaction-payment-skeleton</a><br>\n<br></p>\n<h4><strong>Package.json</strong></h4>\n<p>Your plugin needs to be a node package, this doesn’t mean that need to live in npm you can install the package from a local source or Github if you don’t want to publish your package, keep in mind that you need to customize the package information as you need (name, description, version, main, ….).</p>\n<h4><strong>Graphql Schema</strong></h4>\n<p>You need to let the API know about your plugin name and what data should be saved for your payment method, for this you need to extend the existing Graphql schema:</p>\n<p><strong>reaction-payment-skeleton/src/schemas/schema.graphql</strong></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token string\">\"Data for an reaction payment skeleton\"</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ReactionPaymentSkeletonData</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"The id of the reaction payment payer\"</span>\n <span class=\"token attr-name\">customerId</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> String<span class=\"token operator\">!</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"The name of the reaction payment payer entered by the shopper\"</span>\n <span class=\"token attr-name\">fullName</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> String<span class=\"token operator\">!</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"The card number of the reaction payment payer entered by the shopper\"</span>\n <span class=\"token attr-name\">cardNumber</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> String<span class=\"token operator\">!</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\nextend <span class=\"token keyword\">union</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PaymentData</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ReactionPaymentSkeletonData\n\nextend <span class=\"token keyword\">enum</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PaymentMethodName</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"reaction payment skeleton\"</span>\n reaction_payment_skeleton\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Extending “PaymentMethodName” will allow you to register your payment method in the options list for the administrator interface.</p>\n<p>ReactionPaymentSkeletonData it’s a new PaymentData type that holds all the custom file that you need to save as a result of your payment process.</p>\n<p>Be sure to add this union if this part it’s missing your payment data type will not be registered.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">extend union PaymentData <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ReactionPaymentSkeletonData</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can explore how the schema it’s affected after install your plugin using the Graphql tool <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/graphql-beta\">&#x3C;u>http://localhost:3000/graphql-beta&#x3C;/u></a><br>\n<br></p>\n<h4><strong>Action Functions</strong></h4>\n<p>Your plugin should register some functions capture, authorize, refund, and list refunds, only capture and authorize functions are mandatory the rest it’s just in case that your payment method allows refunds.\nYou can see an example of the functions inside of <strong><em>/reaction-payment-skeleton/src/util</em></strong>, but the most important one it’s the authorize function, this function it’s in charge of all the business logic to connect your payment method with the payment gateway of your choice, here it’s where you are going to receive the data input by the user and make the necessary API calls to validate the data, you need to return a valid payment object, for more detail go to <a href=\"https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider\">&#x3C;u>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider&#x3C;/u></a>.</p>\n<div

operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The custom data that you collect for your payment method going inside of the data object, you can save the data returned by you payment gateway keep in mind that this object it’s referencing the schema that you create in the first step “ReactionPaymentSkeletonData” so all the fields that you need to save for your payment method should be declared in the schema.</p>\n<p>In the example that we provide in the repo (/reaction-payment-skeleton/src/util/reactionPaymentSkeletonCreateAuthorizedPayment.js) we only are saving the data provided by the user and generating a random customerId but you need to implement the business logic and save the necessary data of your payment gateway.</p>\n<p>You can dive into the other functions in the example that are really simple to understand.</p>\n<h4><strong>Plugin Registration</strong></h4>\n<p>You need to register you plugin in the api, for this we need to create a register function that receive the reaction app object where we are going to add a registration object:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n

<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n   <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s explain a bit more about what information we need to provide in the registration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Label:</strong> Human-readable name of the plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> Machine name of the plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Version:</strong> The version of the plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>I18n:</strong> Internationalization, in the example we are passing empty object but you can get more information here (<a href=\"https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/internationalization\">&#x3C;u>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/internationalization&#x3C;/u></a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Graphql:</strong> Here it’s we are going to pass the schema that we create at the beginning of the blog post.</li>\n<li><strong>functionsByType:</strong> you can get more information on <a href=\"https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro\">&#x3C;u>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro&#x3C;/u></a> but basically in the example, we are passing a startup function to add a collection in MongoDB to save our refund data.</li>\n<li><strong>paymentMethods:</strong> here it’s where we declare the new payment method machine name, human-readable name if the payment method can have refunds, and the most important we are passing the action functions (create, authorize, refund, and list refund).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>\n<p>Well, we have our plugin ready now what?; As I say at the beginning of the post the plugin needs to be a node package but can live on npm.org, GitHub, or local in this blog post we are going to take the local approach but it’s not too different from the other 2.</p>\n<p>I am assuming that you are using <a href=\"https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform\">&#x3C;u>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform&#x3C;/u></a> for your development.</p>\n<p><strong>For the installation we need to:</strong></p>\n<p>1.- Create an “api-plugins” folder inside of reaction folder (reaction API system)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> reaction\n<span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> api-plugin</code></pre></div>\n<p>2.- Clone the repo (example one or your custom repo)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone git@github.com:weknowinc/reaction-payment-skeleton.git</code></pre></div>\n<p>3.- Edit the reaction/package.json to add your package from the file system.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n<span class=\"token string\">\"dependencies\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">\"reaction-payment-skeleton\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file:./api-plugins/reaction-payment-skeleton\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">...</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>4.- Install the package, you can achieve this task in 2 ways the first one it’s going into the container and run npm install or rebuild the entire reaction container, my preferred way it’s put the container in dev mode then go into it and install the packages this will allow the rebuild of the API when we do the next step (check <a href=\"https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform\">&#x3C;u>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform&#x3C;/u></a> for more info).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">make</span> init-dev-reaction\ndocker <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">exec</span> -ti reaction_api_1 <span class=\"token function\">bash</span>\n// inside the container\n<span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>5.- Edit plugin.json (/reaction/plugins.json) file to register our new plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"addressValidationTest\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"@reactioncommerce/api-plugin-address-validation-test\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n <span class=\"token string\">\"reactionPaymentSkeleton\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"reaction-payment-skeleton\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>6.- If you have the dev mode enable you only need to wait until the API restart if not you can rebuild your container and it’s ready, you can see your plugin working in the administration interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:4080/settings/payment\">&#x3C;u>http://localhost:4080/settings/payment&#x3C;/u></a>\n<img src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202020-05-27%20a%20la%28s%29%2015.02.32.png\" alt=\"Reaction admin payment settings\"></p>\n<h2><strong>Storefront Component.</strong></h2>\n<p>The other important part when you want to add a payment method it’s the storefront component, we are using <a href=\"https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront\">&#x3C;u>example-storefront&#x3C;/u></a> for the frontend application, this component it’s in charge of display the form and information related to the payment option and here is where you are going to capture the information for your payment method.</p>\n<p>This it’s just a react component, we have an example component (<a href=\"https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component\">&#x3C;u>https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component&#x3C;/u></a>) that you can use as a base for your custom one.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of important props that allow the component to communicated with the outside checkout process.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">  <span class=\"token comment\">/**\n   * Called as the form fields are changed\n   */</span>\n

journey.</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"[Reaction Commerce](https://reactioncommerce.com/) is primarily a headless GraphQL API with a great storefront and administrator interface that you can fork or use as a base for creating your own, that it’s great for customization given you the choice of how to build the entire store.\r\n\r\nReaction commerce came with great documentation ([https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/intro](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/intro)) but event the greatest documentation sometimes has missing points that can be explained better in a blog post and that is the case, we are going to cover the process to create a custom payment method.\r\n\r\nBefore you can start you need to understand a couple of things payment concepts ([https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/concepts-payments](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/concepts-payments)) and how reaction handles their plugin system ([https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro)), you should also check the how to create a payment provider that it’s the base of this post ([https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider)).\r\n\r\nAfter the long introduction finally we can start with the subject that attracts your attention, how can we create a custom payment method, the first thing that we need to understand is that to add a payment method we need 2 pieces of code a reaction API plugin and a react storefront component to show the fields to capture the data provided by the end-user.\r\n\r\n## **Reaction API plugin.**\r\n\r\nYou can use our payment skeleton plugin that we create as a base of your work and I’ll explain the key pieces that you need to customize to accomplish the task. This plugin’s available as npm package [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weknow/reaction-payment-skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@weknow/reaction-payment-skeleton) or in GitHub [reaction-payment-skeleton](https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-skeleton)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Package.json**\r\n\r\nYour plugin needs to be a node package, this doesn’t mean that need to live in npm you can install the package from a local source or Github if you don’t want to publish your package, keep in mind that you need to customize the package information as you need (name, description, version, main, ….).\r\n\r\n#### **Graphql Schema**\r\n\r\nYou need to let the API know about your plugin name and what data should be saved for your payment method, for this you need to extend the existing Graphql schema:\r\n\r\n**reaction-payment-skeleton/src/schemas/schema.graphql**\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n\"Data for an reaction payment skeleton\"\r\ntype ReactionPaymentSkeletonData {\r\n \"The id of the reaction payment payer\"\r\n customerId: String!\r\n \"The name of the reaction payment payer entered by the shopper\"\r\n fullName: String!\r\n \"The card number of the reaction payment payer entered by the shopper\"\r\n cardNumber: String!\r\n}\r\n\r\nextend union PaymentData = ReactionPaymentSkeletonData\r\n\r\nextend enum PaymentMethodName {\r\n \"reaction payment skeleton\"\r\n reaction_payment_skeleton\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtending “PaymentMethodName” will allow you to register your payment method in the options list for the administrator interface.\r\n\r\nReactionPaymentSkeletonData it’s a new PaymentData type that holds all the custom file that you need to save as a result of your payment process.\r\n\r\nBe sure to add this union if this part it’s missing your payment data type will not be registered.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nextend union PaymentData = ReactionPaymentSkeletonData\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can explore how the schema it’s affected after install your plugin using the Graphql tool [\\<u\\>http://localhost:3000/graphql-beta\\</u\\>](http://localhost:3000/graphql-beta)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Action Functions**\r\n\r\nYour plugin should register some functions capture, authorize, refund, and list refunds, only capture and authorize functions are mandatory the rest it’s just in case that your payment method allows refunds.\r\nYou can see an example of the functions inside of **_/reaction-payment-skeleton/src/util_**, but the most important one it’s the authorize function, this function it’s in charge of all the business logic to connect your payment method with the payment gateway of your choice, here it’s where you are going to receive the data input by the user and make the necessary API calls to validate the data, you need to return a valid payment object, for more detail go to [\\<u\\>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider\\</u\\>](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-create-a-payment-provider).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n   _id: Random.id(),\r\n   address: billingAddress,\r\n   amount,\r\n   createdAt: new Date(),\r\n   data: {\r\n     customerId: Random.id(),\r\n     fullName,\r\n     cardNumber,\r\n     gqlType: \"ReactionPaymentSkeletonData\" // GraphQL union resolver uses this\r\n   },\r\n   displayName: `Weknow ${fullName}`,\r\n   method: METHOD,\r\n   mode: \"authorize\",\r\n   name: PAYMENT_METHOD_NAME,\r\n   paymentPluginName: PACKAGE_NAME,\r\n   processor: PROCESSOR,\r\n   riskLevel: \"normal\",\r\n   shopId,\r\n   status: \"created\",\r\n   transactionId: Random.id(),\r\n   transactions: []\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe custom data that you collect for your payment method going inside of the data object, you can save the data returned by you payment gateway keep in mind that this object it’s referencing the schema that you create in the first step “ReactionPaymentSkeletonData” so all the fields that you need to save for your payment method should be declared in the schema.\r\n\r\nIn the example that we provide in the repo (/reaction-payment-skeleton/src/util/reactionPaymentSkeletonCreateAuthorizedPayment.js) we only are saving the data provided by the user and generating a random customerId but you need to implement the business logic and save the necessary data of your payment gateway.\r\n\r\nYou can dive into the other functions in the example that are really simple to understand.\r\n\r\n#### **Plugin Registration**\r\n\r\nYou need to register you plugin in the api, for this we need to create a register function that receive the reaction app object where we are going to add a registration object:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n   label: \"Reaction payment skeleton\",\r\n   name: \"reaction-payment-skeleton\",\r\n   version: pkg.version,\r\n   i18n,\r\n   graphQL: {\r\n     schemas\r\n   },\r\n   functionsByType: {\r\n     startup: [startup]\r\n   },\r\n   paymentMethods: [{\r\n     name: \"reaction_payment_skeleton\",\r\n     canRefund: true,\r\n     displayName: \"Reaction Payment Skeleton\",\r\n     functions: {\r\n       capturePayment: reactionPaymentSkeletonCapturePayment,\r\n       createAuthorizedPayment: reactionPaymentSkeletonCreateAuthorizedPayment,\r\n       createRefund: reactionPaymentSkeletonCreateRefund,\r\n       listRefunds: reactionPaymentSkeletonListRefunds\r\n     }\r\n   }]\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s explain a bit more about what information we need to provide in the registration.\r\n\r\n* **Label:** Human-readable name of the plugin.\r\n* **Name:** Machine name of the plugin.\r\n* **Version:** The version of the plugin.\r\n* **I18n:** Internationalization, in the example we are passing empty object but you can get more information here ([\\<u\\>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/internationalization\\</u\\>](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/internationalization))\r\n* **Graphql:** Here it’s we are going to pass the schema that we create at the beginning of the blog post.\r\n* **functionsByType:** you can get more information on [\\<u\\>https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro\\</u\\>](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/core-plugins-intro) but basically in the example, we are passing a startup function to add a collection in MongoDB to save our refund data.\r\n* **paymentMethods:** here it’s where we declare the new payment method machine name, human-readable name if the payment method can have refunds, and the most important we are passing the action functions (create, authorize, refund, and list refund).\r\n\r\n#### **Installation**\r\n\r\nWell, we have our plugin ready now what?; As I say at the beginning of the post the plugin needs to be a node package but can live on npm.org, GitHub, or local in this blog post we are going to take the local approach but it’s not too different from the other 2.\r\n\r\nI am assuming that you are using [\\<u\\>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform\\</u\\>](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform) for your development.\r\n\r\n**For the installation we need to:**\r\n\r\n1.- Create an “api-plugins” folder inside of reaction folder (reaction API system)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd reaction\r\nmkdir api-plugin\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.- Clone the repo (example one or your custom repo)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:weknowinc/reaction-payment-skeleton.git\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.- Edit the reaction/package.json to add your package from the file system.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n...\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n  ...\r\n  \"reaction-payment-skeleton\": \"file:./api-plugins/reaction-payment-skeleton\"\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.- Install the package, you can achieve this task in 2 ways the first one it’s going into the container and run npm install or rebuild the entire reaction container, my preferred way it’s put the container in dev mode then go into it and install the packages this will allow the rebuild of the API when we do the next step (check [\\<u\\>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform\\</u\\>](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform) for more info).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake init-dev-reaction\r\ndocker exec -ti reaction_api_1 bash\r\n// inside the container\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.- Edit plugin.json (/reaction/plugins.json) file to register our new plugin.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n ...\r\n \"addressValidationTest\": \"@reactioncommerce/api-plugin-address-validation-test\",\r\n \"reactionPaymentSkeleton\": \"reaction-payment-skeleton\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n6.- If you have the dev mode enable you only need to wait until the API restart if not you can rebuild your container and it’s ready, you can see your plugin working in the administration interface.\r\n\r\n[\\<u\\>http://localhost:4080/settings/payment\\</u\\>](http://localhost:4080/settings/payment)\r\n![Reaction admin payment settings](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202020-05-27%20a%20la%28s%29%2015.02.32.png)\r\n\r\n## **Storefront Component.**\r\n\r\nThe other important part when you want to add a payment method it’s the storefront component, we are using [\\<u\\>example-storefront\\</u\\>](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront) for the frontend application, this component it’s in charge of display the form and information related to the payment option and here is where you are going to capture the information for your payment method.\r\n\r\nThis it’s just a react component, we have an example component ([\\<u\\>https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component\\</u\\>](https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component)) that you can use as a base for your custom one.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of important props that allow the component to communicated with the outside checkout process.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  /**\r\n   * Called as the form fields are changed\r\n   */\r\n  onChange: PropTypes.func,\r\n  /**\r\n   * When this action's input data switches between being\r\n   * ready for saving and not ready for saving, this will\r\n   * be called with `true` (ready) or `false`\r\n   */\r\n  onReadyForSaveChange: PropTypes.func,\r\n  /**\r\n   * Called with an object value when this component's `submit`\r\n   * method is called. The object may have `data`, `displayName`,\r\n   * and `amount` properties.\r\n   */\r\n  onSubmit: PropTypes.func\r\nThe other important part it’s where you format the input data that it’s been sent to the payment plugin.\r\n\r\nfunction buildResult({ fullName = null, cardNumber = null }) {\r\n return {\r\n   data: { fullName, cardNumber },\r\n   displayName: fullName ? `Weknow reaction payment skeleton for ${fullName}` : null\r\n };\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis object it’s been received for the authorize function in the input parameter.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreactionPaymentSkeletonCreateAuthorizedPayment(context, input)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the 2 key parts of the component the rest it’s just pure react syntax that you should be able to understand.\r\n\r\n#### **Installation**\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install this component is by cloning the repo ([\\<u\\>https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component\\</u\\>](https://github.com/weknowinc/reaction-payment-storefront-component)) inside of [\\<u\\>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/tree/trunk/src/components\\</u\\>](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/tree/trunk/src/components) then you need to edit [\\<u\\>https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/blob/trunk/src/custom/paymentMethods.js\\</u\\>](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/blob/trunk/src/custom/paymentMethods.js) file to register this component and use it for the new payment method that you just created.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport ExampleIOUPaymentForm from \"@reactioncommerce/components/ExampleIOUPaymentForm/v1\";\r\nimport StripePaymentInput from \"@reactioncommerce/components/StripePaymentInput/v1\";\r\nimport ReactionPaymentStorefront from '../components/reaction-payment-storefront-component/PaymentStorefrontComponent';\r\n\r\nconst paymentMethods = [\r\n {\r\n   displayName: \"Credit Card\",\r\n   InputComponent: StripePaymentInput,\r\n   name: \"stripe_card\",\r\n   shouldCollectBillingAddress: true\r\n },\r\n {\r\n   displayName: \"IOU\",\r\n   InputComponent: ExampleIOUPaymentForm,\r\n   name: \"iou_example\",\r\n   shouldCollectBillingAddress: true\r\n },\r\n {\r\n   displayName: \"Reaction Payment Skeleton\",\r\n   InputComponent: ReactionPaymentStorefront,\r\n   name: \"reaction_payment_skeleton\",\r\n   shouldCollectBillingAddress: true\r\n }\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default paymentMethods;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember run the “example-storefront” in dev mode (make init-dev-example-storefront) this will allow you to have auto-reload, if it is not enabled you should rebuild your container.\r\n\r\nI hope that this blog post helps you with your Reaction commerce journey.","excerpt":"Reaction Commerce is primarily a headless GraphQL API with a great storefront and administrator interface that you can fork or use as a base…"}}},"field_resume":"Reaction Commerce is primarily a headless GraphQL API with a great storefront and administrator interface that you can fork or use as a base for creating your own, you can use our payment skeleton plugin that we create as a base of your payment plugin.","relationships":{"uid":{"field_full_name":"Manuel Santibanez"},"field_image":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":null}}},"field_preview":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/501b247af0bd3eec5c9bffc02e5625bb/14b42/agile.jpg","srcSet":"/static/501b247af0bd3eec5c9bffc02e5625bb/f836f/agile.jpg 200w,\n/static/501b247af0bd3eec5c9bffc02e5625bb/2244e/agile.jpg 400w,\n/static/501b247af0bd3eec5c9bffc02e5625bb/14b42/agile.jpg 800w,\n/static/501b247af0bd3eec5c9bffc02e5625bb/47498/agile.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"6e138c4e-63d1-5352-ae89-a5b3aa92d331","title":"Reaction Commerce: does the world really need another e-commerce platform?","path":{"alias":"/blog/reaction-commerce-does-world-really-need-another-e-commerce-platform"},"created":"Jun 8, 2020","fields":{"markdownBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It feels like the e-commerce arena is already flooded with too many options that aren't that different from each other.

We're talking about ambitious brands and retailers that want to retain ultimate control over the online shopping experience they want to provide for their customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you enjoy to geek out about the technical ins and outs, Reaction Commerce is built on a very modern stack that includes React, GraphQL, Docker, NextJS, and MeteorJS. And for the developers out there, starting with the release of version 3.0, Reaction Commerce is now a fully headless commerce stack, which means that you can build custom storefront interfaces without having to touch the core Reaction API or the Admin back end.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Why choose Reaction Commerce?&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This all sounds very nice on paper, but why (and most importantly, when) should you choose Reaction Commerce to build your online store?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Simply put, Reaction Commerce is the ideal fit when you want to customize anything and everything about your commerce solution, including which specific CMS to use on the front end, which payment options to offer, and basically any other feature or piece of functionality that relates to your specific business model. This allows you to easily replace anything from your platform as your business evolves, as opposed to being restricted by the constraints of a turnkey system. In addition, its microservices architecture and API-first nature allows for easy integration with your already existing systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such flexibility is exactly what the stakeholders from the first 2 projects we are developing in this platform were looking for, and as we dig deeper into its features we are just starting to realize the huge potential that Reaction Commerce has to offer in a field that has become stagnant by the dominance of more rigid alternatives. Interestingly enough, Reaction Commerce has been recently <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/mailchimp-acquires-reaction-commerce/\">acquired by Mailchimp</a>, but no need to fret: Mailchimp plans to keep Reaction Commerce as an Open Source product and continue supporting its community of developers.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to know more about Reaction Commerce and see if it's the right fit for you, get in touch with us <a href=\"https://weknowinc.com/contact\">here</a>.</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"<p>It feels like the e-commerce arena is already flooded with too many options that aren't that different from each other.

Reaction Commerce checked all these boxes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What exactly is Reaction Commerce?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaction Commerce is an<em> \"API-first, modular commerce stack with a service-based architecture built to deliver flexibility and freedom at scale\".</em> Fluff aside, Reaction Commerce is the platform you need when out-of-the-box solutions like Shopify just won't cut it for your particular business needs. We're talking about ambitious brands and retailers that want to retain ultimate control over the online shopping experience they want to provide for their customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy to geek out about the technical ins and outs, Reaction Commerce is built on a very modern stack that includes React, GraphQL, Docker, NextJS, and MeteorJS. And for the developers out there, starting with the release of version 3.0, Reaction Commerce is now a fully headless commerce stack, which means that you can build custom storefront interfaces without having to touch the core Reaction API or the Admin back end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why choose Reaction Commerce?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This all sounds very nice on paper, but why (and most importantly, when) should you choose Reaction Commerce to build your online store?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, Reaction Commerce is the ideal fit when you want to customize anything and everything about your commerce solution, including which specific CMS to use on the front end, which payment options to offer, and basically any other feature or piece of functionality that relates to your specific business model. This allows you to easily replace anything from your platform as your business evolves, as opposed to being restricted by the constraints of a turnkey system. In addition, its microservices architecture and API-first nature allows for easy integration with your already existing systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such flexibility is exactly what the stakeholders from the first 2 projects we are developing in this platform were looking for, and as we dig deeper into its features we are just starting to realize the huge potential that Reaction Commerce has to offer in a field that has become stagnant by the dominance of more rigid alternatives. Interestingly enough, Reaction Commerce has been recently <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/mailchimp-acquires-reaction-commerce/\">acquired by Mailchimp</a>, but no need to fret: Mailchimp plans to keep Reaction Commerce as an Open Source product and continue supporting its community of developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like to know more about Reaction Commerce and see if it's the right fit for you, get in touch with us <a href=\"https://weknowinc.com/contact\">here</a>.</p>\r\n","excerpt":""}}},"field_resume":"(Short answer: yes)","relationships":{"uid":{"field_full_name":"Andres Ávila"},"field_image":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":null}}},"field_preview":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/8d9207e143868e76dee02737be5660e8/14b42/remote-drupal-development-team.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8d9207e143868e76dee02737be5660e8/f836f/remote-drupal-development-team.jpg 200w,\n/static/8d9207e143868e76dee02737be5660e8/2244e/remote-drupal-development-team.jpg 400w,\n/static/8d9207e143868e76dee02737be5660e8/14b42/remote-drupal-development-team.jpg 800w,\n/static/8d9207e143868e76dee02737be5660e8/47498/remote-drupal-development-team.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d72a978a-8cc6-5039-bb50-f6c64a129543","title":"Technical Staff Augmentation Hub","path":{"alias":"/blog/technical-staff-augmentation-hub"},"created":"May 6, 2020","fields":{"markdownBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If you’ve been thinking about investing in technical staff augmentation or nearshore software development services at your company, you may be wondering what your best option is.

Marcy is a great educator and she was always willing to elaborate more when someone had a question. We were very impressed on how she managed to explain really well all the material she had. The main focus was how to build fast, accessible sites with Gatsby from server-side rendering and progressive enhancement to integration and unit testing of components and pages. If you want to it check out the material go here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://marcysutton.github.io/gatsby-a11y-workshop\">App URL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marcysutton.github.io/gatsby-a11y-workshop/slides/\">Workshop slides</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This workshop explored on how to incorporate accessibility into your web development workflow. How to debug your sites and applications using the latest tools on accessibility. How to apply accessibility to React web applications with Gatsby, while learning how accessibility applies to other stacks. The benefits of manual and automated testing, semantic markup, unobtrusive animation, progressive enhancement and much more.

He gave examples of how to use dynamic elements on Gatsby.js, he presented in just 15 min examples and plugins to work with Comments, Forms, Memberships, Ecommerce, LMS and Dynamic Gutenberg Blocks.</p>\n<p>You can find the slides of this talk over here: <a href=\"https://wp.zacgordon.com/2020/02/03/highly-dynamic-wordpress-sites-at-gatsby-days-la-2020/\">https://wp.zacgordon.com/2020/02/03/highly-dynamic-wordpress-sites-at-gatsby-days-la-2020/</a><br>\n<br>\nWhile we were  listening to Kyle Mathews and the people who works in gatsby, we realized that they are working really hard to improve gatsby even more than they achieved already, gatsby is fast but they aren’t just sitting there, they are working on the developer experience, plugins, the speed of the page load, the speed of code compiling which already is quicker compared to many other technologies and they just launched gatsby themes a few months ago which is making development easier.</p>\n<p>Many outstanding companies are trusting in gatsby to create their static content pages and websites such as tinder, MDX and even e-commerce parties are integrating gatsby into their environments; that tells us how trustworthy gatsby is being so young, and it was awesome to see that many of them are supporting gatsby creating more and more plugins to integrate other technologies such as, shopify, drupal and wordpress.</p>\n<p>We also had 2 unconference sessions. In these sessions we  participated in the gatsby accessibility and how to do beautiful themes on gatsby. In both sessions we shared knowledge with other attendees and we talked about our experience building websites with gatsby using theme-UI, tailwind css, and accessibility tools as ANDY.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 46.875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/7f9e3/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.webp 256w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/1bb89/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.webp 512w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/53334/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.webp 1024w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/ff8d7/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.webp 1440w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/11e76/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpg 256w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/a15fd/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpg 512w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/c3413/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpg 1024w,\n/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/06430/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpg 1440w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/9914ded6144cbac9c626fd93dd7d2a2b/c3413/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Gatsby.js party 2020\"\n          title=\"Gatsby.js party 2020\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The day ended with a happy hour. Drinks, food and open source community, what a wonderful combination! . we had the chance to chat more in depth with Kyle, Hasim, Jason  and other community fellows about the future of Gatsby on Latin America and how to involve more people in the region.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>For me this was an amazing experience and i can't wait to attend the next one and share our experience building awesome Drupal-Gatsby apps. We were excited for the opportunity to learn and meet new open source advocates.</p>\n<p>In case you missed the event you can get the Live stream of Gatsby Days on youtube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxxYParyAGk&#x26;feature=youtu.be\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxxYParyAGk&#x26;feature=youtu.be</a>****</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"The first Gatsby day 2020 was held at Convene in downtown Los Angeles, CA . This was our first time attending as members of weKnow Inc and it surely won’t be our last.  We were was very interested in attending this Gatsby event because this tool is fairly new but is gaining a lot of traction really quickly,  we have worked in some projects and can’t wait to work with Gatsby even more because it's very powerful: you can build fast websites which is important for search engines and to have the user happy while using them, and the best thing is that its fun to work with, it has a great developer experience and also with the help of typescript, maintaining a Gatsby site doesn't become a painful task.\r\n\r\n![weKnow Inc at Gatsby Day LA 2020 Roberto and Jose](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/8756fe0026207c4ce24e1dc0d79321ff/Remedios-amaral-gatsbyDay.jpeg)\r\n\r\nThis event was something special for many reasons but one in particular : weKnow is looking forward to organize a gatsby day in Latin America, as we are a remote company, we have JavaScript, React and Gatsby developers on all Latin America  and we will be happy to support this open source project and future events in places such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador or Colombia. We at weKnow Inc collaborate on several open source projects already, Drupal, WordPress, etc and support several communities across the globe.\r\n\r\n### Sunday  Pre-Conference Workshop\r\n\r\n![Marcy Sutton Accessibility Speaker](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/fe59d368036ff272ad32b1f83b36af7a/marcySuttonGatsbyDay2020.png)\r\n\r\nIntro to Building Accessible Sites with Gatsby dictated by Marcy Sutton [@marcysutton](twitter.com/marcysutton/).  As an accessibility advocates, we were glad to learn more on the subject. Marcy is a great educator and she was always willing to elaborate more when someone had a question. We were very impressed on how she managed to explain really well all the material she had. The main focus was how to build fast, accessible sites with Gatsby from server-side rendering and progressive enhancement to integration and unit testing of components and pages. If you want to it check out the material go here:\r\n\r\n* [App URL](https://marcysutton.github.io/gatsby-a11y-workshop)\r\n* [Workshop slides](https://marcysutton.github.io/gatsby-a11y-workshop/slides/)\r\n\r\nThis workshop explored on how to incorporate accessibility into your web development workflow. How to debug your sites and applications using the latest tools on accessibility. How to apply accessibility to React web applications with Gatsby, while learning how accessibility applies to other stacks. The benefits of manual and automated testing, semantic markup, unobtrusive animation, progressive enhancement and much more. We were  also gladly impressed by how the community is really committed to make websites accessible to everyone, they really think on every way possible to improve the user experience for everyone with or without a disability, that showed us why gatsby is growing as a technology and as a community this fast.\r\n\r\nWe personally enjoyed discovering new tools like Accessibility Insights for Web (https://accessibilityinsights.io/), or learn about functional components, client-side routing and the automation testing with Selenium and Cypress on Gatsby.js.\r\n\r\n### The Monday Gatsby Day LA 2020 event\r\n\r\n![Gatsby Day Morning](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/54ffb8397fb83abfd19477ac16305e6e/gatsbyDayMorning.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWe woke up very early on Monday to attend the main event.

We talked about a gatsby day 2020 in Costa Rica just before his talk and he was very pleased about the idea.\r\n\r\n![Kyle Mathews Gatsby weKnow Latinoamerica](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/106e911d1e27afc4aa896efbdce1afba/gatsbyWeKnowInc.jpg)\r\n\r\nThen we had many great speakers as Dustin Schau, Joshua Coumeau, Kyle Boss, Daniel Kim, Gatare Libère, Yuraima Estevez, Kathleen McMahon, Paul Veen, Grant Glidewell and Zac Gordon with one of my favorite talk of the day. He gave examples of how to use dynamic elements on Gatsby.js, he presented in just 15 min examples and plugins to work with Comments, Forms, Memberships, Ecommerce, LMS and Dynamic Gutenberg Blocks.\r\n\r\nYou can find the slides of this talk over here: [https://wp.zacgordon.com/2020/02/03/highly-dynamic-wordpress-sites-at-gatsby-days-la-2020/](https://wp.zacgordon.com/2020/02/03/highly-dynamic-wordpress-sites-at-gatsby-days-la-2020/)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we were  listening to Kyle Mathews and the people who works in gatsby, we realized that they are working really hard to improve gatsby even more than they achieved already, gatsby is fast but they aren’t just sitting there, they are working on the developer experience, plugins, the speed of the page load, the speed of code compiling which already is quicker compared to many other technologies and they just launched gatsby themes a few months ago which is making development easier.\r\n\r\nMany outstanding companies are trusting in gatsby to create their static content pages and websites such as tinder, MDX and even e-commerce parties are integrating gatsby into their environments; that tells us how trustworthy gatsby is being so young, and it was awesome to see that many of them are supporting gatsby creating more and more plugins to integrate other technologies such as, shopify, drupal and wordpress.\r\n\r\nWe also had 2 unconference sessions. In these sessions we  participated in the gatsby accessibility and how to do beautiful themes on gatsby. In both sessions we shared knowledge with other attendees and we talked about our experience building websites with gatsby using theme-UI, tailwind css, and accessibility tools as ANDY.\r\n\r\n![Gatsby.js party 2020](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/a18c606dc979b23cfb771c7abbcce428/gatsbyPartyweKnowInc.jpeg)\r\n\r\nThe day ended with a happy hour. Drinks, food and open source community, what a wonderful combination! . we had the chance to chat more in depth with Kyle, Hasim, Jason  and other community fellows about the future of Gatsby on Latin America and how to involve more people in the region.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nFor me this was an amazing experience and i can't wait to attend the next one and share our experience building awesome Drupal-Gatsby apps. We were excited for the opportunity to learn and meet new open source advocates.\r\n\r\nIn case you missed the event you can get the Live stream of Gatsby Days on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxxYParyAGk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxxYParyAGk&feature=youtu.be)\\*\\*\\*\\*","excerpt":"The first Gatsby day 2020 was held at Convene in downtown Los Angeles, CA .

A good way to learn and show how capable someone is to learn new things fast is by making personal projects that can be shown. I also talked with Andrew Godwin about how planning is important in open source projects. It is great to be excited about personal projects delimited in a timeline and set of goals. Planning is important.</p>\n<p>Finally, the PyCon Colombia 2020 was an encouraging event for me because I’ve seen what you can build with tools of the python ecosystem to build data science or artificial intelligence projects. Combining web development with these new fields for me sounds very exciting and promising for passionate geeks and for the industry of technology itself.\nPeople are the key to communities, their passion and sharing a same philosophy</p>\n<p>*<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia/status/1226629759884550145/photo/1\">Cover photo</a> courtesy of PyCon Colombia 2020 media team</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"For me, it is a great pleasure to go back home and spend time with the community of Python Colombia. One of the many reasons to come is because from experience as a co-organizer I know from first hand that the team puts a lot of effort in giving the best experience to all participants and as an example, you can see the wide range of topics and international guests invited to the event. From security, web development, data science, and community topics it is a remarkable environment to share knowledge, meet interesting people and learn.\r\n\r\nThis year, the 476 assistants of the event had the opportunity to learn from keynote speakers like:\r\n\r\n* [Andrew Godwin](https://www.pycon.co/en/keynotes/andrew-godwin/), creator of Django channels, core developer in Django and principal engineer at Eventbrite taught us the value behind the word engineer. We build and invent new products and technologies, but to do so, we need to nurture soft skills like communication and collaboration.\r\n\r\n![/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/19770b948e453e1dced1019ec530f0df/engineers_invent.jpg)\r\n\r\n* [Emily Morehouse](https://www.pycon.co/en/keynotes/emily-morehouse/), core Python developer, co-founder and director of engineering at Cuttlesoft.

A good way to learn and show how capable someone is to learn new things fast is by making personal projects that can be shown. I also talked with Andrew Godwin about how planning is important in open source projects. It is great to be excited about personal projects delimited in a timeline and set of goals. Planning is important.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PyCon Colombia 2020 was an encouraging event for me because I’ve seen what you can build with tools of the python ecosystem to build data science or artificial intelligence projects. Combining web development with these new fields for me sounds very exciting and promising for passionate geeks and for the industry of technology itself.\r\nPeople are the key to communities, their passion and sharing a same philosophy\r\n\r\n*[Cover photo](https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia/status/1226629759884550145/photo/1) courtesy of PyCon Colombia 2020 media team","excerpt":"For me, it is a great pleasure to go back home and spend time with the community of Python Colombia.

I already took this course once and it’s second part <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift\">Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to learning and discover your hidden potential</a> and I can say -as many others- that they are totally worthy. They are worthy because in the tech industry, we need to be studying all the time to keep up with technology and it is better to know the proper tools to hack your brain and study techniques for becoming more efficient learners and productive developers.</p>\n<p>Even now I am thinking of retaking the course to keep practicing the techniques and concepts given in it for allowing me to help grow my career as a software developer. With that in mind, I decided to write about the course for those who haven’t taken it to have an idea of what to expect and also as a summary for myself.</p>\n<p>The course is divided in 4 weeks, each one with quizzes, complementary videos, interviews to renowned persons and assignments. For the sake of following an order, I’ll keep this order as well within this post and the second part.</p>\n<h2>1. What is learning?</h2>\n<p>In this section of the course, we learn about the two modes in which the brain operates when learning a new subject. Professor Oakley calls these two modes of thinking focused mode and diffuse mode.</p>\n<p>As the name explains, in the focused mode your brain concentrates on an idea. This mode is the best for working or studying familiar problems that require a lot of your time.</p>\n<p>The diffused mode is good for letting your mind relax and wander any idea that comes to you. It is good for helping your brain work on unfamiliar problems or learning new concepts.</p>\n<p>Switching from one mode to the other will help you learn and work into new ideas more easily. It is a process that takes time and that’s why you need to allow your brain time to master a new concept or idea.</p>\n<h3>How our brain behaves when learning</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/7f9e3/neurons-1773922_640.webp 256w,\n/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/1bb89/neurons-1773922_640.webp 512w,\n/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/797b9/neurons-1773922_640.webp 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/11e76/neurons-1773922_640.jpg 256w,\n/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/a15fd/neurons-1773922_640.jpg 512w,\n/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/d6032/neurons-1773922_640.jpg 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/bd03cb1bb4a0c0ba1049fb3dc6e4223a/d6032/neurons-1773922_640.jpg\"\n          alt=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          title=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>It is usual to be proud when one becomes very skillful playing chess or doing heavy big calculations without using calculators. Even though it is impressive, it takes years of learning and practice. Something that modern computers are able to learn and do with more efficiency in less time. There are more complex activities that computers are not yet capable of doing, such as running, walking or playing a sport.</p>\n<p>Every time we take a nap or sleep our neurons create new connections with each other, enhancing our memory with the newly learned concepts. This constant change will make you realize that even though our brains are mature they are constantly changing and making new connections. Put it this way, It is like every time we wake up after a nap or a night of sleep, we come with a new upgraded brain.</p>\n<p>One thing that makes us avoid learning new things is procrastination. Researchers have found that every time we want to do something that bothers us, the brain activates the same regions than pain and after a while, of doing this activity the uneasy sensation disappears. The thing with procrastination is that we end up doing something that brings us happiness momentarily, avoiding the activity that makes us worry at the beginning. </p>\n<p>One useful technique to avoid procrastination is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">Pomodore technique</a>, which consists of 25 minutes of intense mental work followed by 5 minutes of mental relaxation. It is important to give yourself a reward in this 5 minutes frame, where it can be web surfing, drinking coffee, stretching or chit-chatting while letting your brain enter in a more relaxed mode (diffused mode ;) )</p>\n<h3>Practice makes permanent</h3>\n<p>When a concept seems to be more abstract and difficult to understand, one useful way to master it is to practice. Practice will allow your neural connections to become stronger during your learning process.</p>\n<p><em>Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you.</em>\n<em>Dr Barbara Oakely</em></p>\n<p>Remember to take a break after intense study or practice, while in diffuse mode, your brain will work away in the background and help you with conceptual understanding.</p>\n<p>One good tip here is interleaving. That is providing intelligent variety in your studies. Mix up the problems from different chapters. It can make your learning a little bit more challenging, but it helps you learn more deeply.</p>\n<h3>Working Memory and Long Term Memory</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/7f9e3/library-2507902_640.webp 256w,\n/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/1bb89/library-2507902_640.webp 512w,\n/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/797b9/library-2507902_640.webp 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/11e76/library-2507902_640.jpg 256w,\n/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/a15fd/library-2507902_640.jpg 512w,\n/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/d6032/library-2507902_640.jpg 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/82fd25877969151cd1486fbf892ed04c/d6032/library-2507902_640.jpg\"\n          alt=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          title=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>There are 2 kinds of memories which the course will focus on.</p>\n<p>Working memory is the part of your memory related to what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind. It is also connected to your long term memory and can only hold 4 chunks of information. For making a new concept stay in this memory you will need repetition, like when you try to memorize a phone number. Short term memory is like an inefficient mental blackboard.</p>\n<p>Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a huge storage warehouse. To put something in the long term memory you need to revisit it a few times to increase the chances to be able to find it whenever you will need it later. This type of memory is so immense that it has room for billions of items. There are so many that they can bury each other. This memory is important because it is where you store fundamental concepts and techniques related to whatever you are learning.</p>\n<p>Spaced repetition is the technique that will allow you to move information from your working memory to your long term memory.

You can imagine this mode ( your prefrontal cortex working) as an octopus that is picking information of a group of neurons to fill each of the 4 slots of memory that we talked about earlier in the working memory section.</p>\n<p>This attention mode can be improved if you learn like a baby learning a new language. For example, when a Japanese baby learns the word mom (<strong>okaasan</strong>), he can associate that new knowledge with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sound of the word okaasan coming from his mother mouth</li>\n<li>Answering to her call</li>\n<li>Remembering the smile of his mother as she carries her baby in her arms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually this new logic became so natural to the baby as breathing. That’s because a lot of neurons are fired and wired together to cement the relationship between the sound mama (<strong>okaasan</strong>) and her smiling face.</p>\n<p>The concept of neural chunks also applies to fields like sports, music, dance or any activity where humans can get good at.</p>\n<p><em>Focused practice, repetition and the creation of strong memory traces helps you to create chunks.</em>\n<em>Dr Barbara Oakley</em></p>\n<p>Please be aware that your prefrontal cortex doesn’t seem to work well when you are angry, stressed or afraid.</p>\n<h3>How to form a chunk</h3>\n<p>Let’s put this into context and let’s say you are going to learn the basics of playing tennis. In the beginning, you need to learn <strong>the patterns</strong> separately in order to play a proper single game or match completely. For that purpose, you need to practice a lot about how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold the racket</li>\n<li>The forehand movement</li>\n<li>The backhand movement</li>\n<li>Serve</li>\n<li>Move inside the court. Footwork</li>\n<li>Hand-eye coordination</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each one is not enough to play tennis but if you mixed them together you will have a very complex and well-grained chunk. Best chunks are the ones that you don’t have to think about the patterns consciously and individually. The information comes to you naturally. Like in the Japanese baby example.</p>\n<p>In math and science, every time you are learning a new topic, you usually start studying with worked-out problems. This is because for the first time of solving a problem you will have a very cognitive load. This technique helps you understand why the steps for solving it work that way. See the key aspects of the solution. In the context of tennis, watching a tennis match will help you see a more advanced player’s game and understand every pattern and their purpose in the game.</p>\n<h3>Steps to make a chunk</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAB/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAW6c4GTV/8QAHBAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDERIAEyEi/9oACAEBAAEFAg5sLg8EdmFKVchu2f/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh/9oACAEDAQE/AVf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIv/aAAgBAgEBPwFL/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECIRIxQZGh/9oACAEBAAY/ApJaHlKinRJpHPZvw//EABkQAQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIQAxkf/aAAgBAQABPyGUJ4eRAc7TgV93BhD1hYyZjoqjM5//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEKfv/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERUf/aAAgBAwEBPxCF7f/EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABYXH/2gAIAQIBAT8Qm2H/xAAbEAEBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUGBkf/aAAgBAQABPxCuwiqVvpDZlDzHLMVFagjb+ZEdqKJuQrruOtZobHxMl+AacM//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/7f9e3/study-laptop.webp 256w,\n/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/1bb89/study-laptop.webp 512w,\n/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/797b9/study-laptop.webp 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/11e76/study-laptop.jpg 256w,\n/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/a15fd/study-laptop.jpg 512w,\n/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/d6032/study-laptop.jpg 640w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/ab79cb303356b39de88bb3e5e50144b9/d6032/study-laptop.jpg\"\n          alt=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          title=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid distractions to help you make new neural patterns and connecting them with pre-existing patterns.

I already took this course once and it’s second part [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to learning and discover your hidden potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift) and I can say -as many others- that they are totally worthy. They are worthy because in the tech industry, we need to be studying all the time to keep up with technology and it is better to know the proper tools to hack your brain and study techniques for becoming more efficient learners and productive developers.\r\n\r\nEven now I am thinking of retaking the course to keep practicing the techniques and concepts given in it for allowing me to help grow my career as a software developer. With that in mind, I decided to write about the course for those who haven’t taken it to have an idea of what to expect and also as a summary for myself.\r\n\r\nThe course is divided in 4 weeks, each one with quizzes, complementary videos, interviews to renowned persons and assignments. For the sake of following an order, I’ll keep this order as well within this post and the second part.\r\n\r\n## 1\\. What is learning?\r\n\r\nIn this section of the course, we learn about the two modes in which the brain operates when learning a new subject. Professor Oakley calls these two modes of thinking focused mode and diffuse mode.\r\n\r\nAs the name explains, in the focused mode your brain concentrates on an idea. This mode is the best for working or studying familiar problems that require a lot of your time.\r\n\r\nThe diffused mode is good for letting your mind relax and wander any idea that comes to you. It is good for helping your brain work on unfamiliar problems or learning new concepts.\r\n\r\nSwitching from one mode to the other will help you learn and work into new ideas more easily. It is a process that takes time and that’s why you need to allow your brain time to master a new concept or idea.\r\n\r\n### How our brain behaves when learning\r\n\r\n![/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/abfc0a48801ab2193e1013c442325fb0/neurons-1773922_640.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt is usual to be proud when one becomes very skillful playing chess or doing heavy big calculations without using calculators. Even though it is impressive, it takes years of learning and practice. Something that modern computers are able to learn and do with more efficiency in less time. There are more complex activities that computers are not yet capable of doing, such as running, walking or playing a sport.\r\n\r\nEvery time we take a nap or sleep our neurons create new connections with each other, enhancing our memory with the newly learned concepts. This constant change will make you realize that even though our brains are mature they are constantly changing and making new connections. Put it this way, It is like every time we wake up after a nap or a night of sleep, we come with a new upgraded brain.\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes us avoid learning new things is procrastination. Researchers have found that every time we want to do something that bothers us, the brain activates the same regions than pain and after a while, of doing this activity the uneasy sensation disappears. The thing with procrastination is that we end up doing something that brings us happiness momentarily, avoiding the activity that makes us worry at the beginning. \r\n\r\nOne useful technique to avoid procrastination is the [Pomodore technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which consists of 25 minutes of intense mental work followed by 5 minutes of mental relaxation. It is important to give yourself a reward in this 5 minutes frame, where it can be web surfing, drinking coffee, stretching or chit-chatting while letting your brain enter in a more relaxed mode (diffused mode ;) )\r\n\r\n### Practice makes permanent\r\n\r\nWhen a concept seems to be more abstract and difficult to understand, one useful way to master it is to practice. Practice will allow your neural connections to become stronger during your learning process.\r\n\r\n_Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you._\r\n_Dr Barbara Oakely_\r\n\r\nRemember to take a break after intense study or practice, while in diffuse mode, your brain will work away in the background and help you with conceptual understanding.\r\n\r\nOne good tip here is interleaving. That is providing intelligent variety in your studies. Mix up the problems from different chapters. It can make your learning a little bit more challenging, but it helps you learn more deeply.\r\n\r\n### Working Memory and Long Term Memory\r\n\r\n![/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/7e02b15ae39c0823770cc3070322c8ae/library-2507902_640.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 kinds of memories which the course will focus on.\r\n\r\nWorking memory is the part of your memory related to what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind. It is also connected to your long term memory and can only hold 4 chunks of information. For making a new concept stay in this memory you will need repetition, like when you try to memorize a phone number. Short term memory is like an inefficient mental blackboard.\r\n\r\nLong term memory, on the other hand, is like a huge storage warehouse. To put something in the long term memory you need to revisit it a few times to increase the chances to be able to find it whenever you will need it later. This type of memory is so immense that it has room for billions of items. There are so many that they can bury each other. This memory is important because it is where you store fundamental concepts and techniques related to whatever you are learning.\r\n\r\nSpaced repetition is the technique that will allow you to move information from your working memory to your long term memory. It consists of repeating what you are trying to learn, but instead of doing it intensely you need to space out your repetition. Rather than repeating something 30 times in a session of study, practice it the same amount of times in several days to give your synaptic connections time to form and strengthen.\r\n\r\n### The importance of sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is an important part of the learning process because it can help you:\r\n\r\n* Keep you healthy by cleaning metabolic toxins\r\n* Allow the brain to strengthen neural patterns, helping you with the tougher concepts of your learning\r\n\r\nLack of sleep can be associated with nasty conditions like headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes...basically dying earlier.\r\n\r\n## 2\\. Chunking\r\n\r\n![/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/6d691d38530d88edddb0aae989d0f091/puzzle-1261138_640.jpg)\r\n\r\nAccording to the course, a chunk is:\r\n\r\n_Compact packages of information that your mind can easily access._\r\n_Dr Barbara Oakley_\r\n\r\nAnd the act of chunking is:\r\n\r\n_The mental leap that helps you unite bits of information through meaning._\r\n_Dr Barbara Oakley_\r\n\r\nThe chunk takes place in the prefrontal cortex of your brain by every time your attention focuses on new learning. You can imagine this mode ( your prefrontal cortex working) as an octopus that is picking information of a group of neurons to fill each of the 4 slots of memory that we talked about earlier in the working memory section.\r\n\r\nThis attention mode can be improved if you learn like a baby learning a new language. For example, when a Japanese baby learns the word mom (**okaasan**), he can associate that new knowledge with:\r\n\r\n* The sound of the word okaasan coming from his mother mouth\r\n* Answering to her call\r\n* Remembering the smile of his mother as she carries her baby in her arms.\r\n\r\nEventually this new logic became so natural to the baby as breathing. That’s because a lot of neurons are fired and wired together to cement the relationship between the sound mama (**okaasan**) and her smiling face.\r\n\r\nThe concept of neural chunks also applies to fields like sports, music, dance or any activity where humans can get good at.\r\n\r\n_Focused practice, repetition and the creation of strong memory traces helps you to create chunks._\r\n_Dr Barbara Oakley_\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that your prefrontal cortex doesn’t seem to work well when you are angry, stressed or afraid.\r\n\r\n### How to form a chunk\r\n\r\nLet’s put this into context and let’s say you are going to learn the basics of playing tennis. In the beginning, you need to learn **the patterns** separately in order to play a proper single game or match completely. For that purpose, you need to practice a lot about how to:\r\n\r\n* Hold the racket\r\n* The forehand movement\r\n* The backhand movement\r\n* Serve\r\n* Move inside the court.

Avoid distractions to help you make new neural patterns and connecting them with pre-existing patterns. You want the 4 slots of your memory to focus only on what you are learning.\r\nShift from focused thinking to diffuse thinking to allow your brain to figure out what is going on in particular new learning material.\r\n2. Understanding. Making relations and seeing the big picture of whatever you are learning.\r\nGain context. Learn not just how to use the chunk but when to use it (or not). For example, when starting a new chapter of a book, take 2 minutes to read all of it first to grasp some context of the information you will learn.\r\nDon’t confuse the aha! moment of understanding with solid expertise\r\n3. Practice and repetition. In math and science related topics, just close the book and try to solve a problem with what you understand. Solve the problem yourself.\r\n\r\nBottom up learning (chunking) and top-down learning (big picture) will help you master any material.\r\n\r\n### Illusions of competence in learning\r\n\r\n* Reread. According to psychologist Jeffrey Karpicke in his paper [“Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping”](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772), recalling (mental retrieval of key ideas) what you just learnt is a better approach to studying new material than rereading it.

This can throw you off when you take the real test because tests are usually held in a different room.\r\n\r\n_By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environments, you become independent of the cues from any one given location._\r\n_Dr Barbara Oakley_\r\n\r\nI will continue this article with a second part where we will analyze more content about procrastination and unlocking your potential.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n* [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\r\n* [https://reddit.com/5950tm](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/)","excerpt":"If you are an avid learner there is a chance you probably have heard of the famous course Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to…"}}},"field_resume":"It is better to know the proper tools for hacking your brain and study techniques to become efficient learners and developers.","relationships":{"uid":{"field_full_name":"Javier Daza"},"field_image":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/14b42/main_image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/f836f/main_image.jpg 200w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/2244e/main_image.jpg 400w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/14b42/main_image.jpg 800w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/47498/main_image.jpg 1200w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/ec6c5/main_image.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"field_preview":{"relationships":{"field_media_image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/14b42/main_image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/f836f/main_image.jpg 200w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/2244e/main_image.jpg 400w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/14b42/main_image.jpg 800w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/47498/main_image.jpg 1200w,\n/static/d69e3c93d4edd2811fc58e7f60035a31/ec6c5/main_image.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"b3707f43-e7ff-597d-b962-6c1171ad9855","title":"PyCon Japan 2019 Recap","path":{"alias":"/blog/pycon-japan-2019-recap"},"created":"Nov 21, 2019","fields":{"markdownBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Coming to Japan for a technology conference has always been my dream since university. A lot of experience and learnings from cultural and technical aspects came from this. In this article, I will try to summarize my take aways as a developer and fan of the Japanese culture.</p>\n<h3>Development sprints</h3>\n<p>My experience started with the development sprints held at the center of Shibuya, one of the iconic areas inside Tokyo. As my first sprint, expectations were high and I couldn’t even gasper how will they be. There were a lot of proposed projects like:<br>\n<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making c wrappers for python</li>\n<li>Code for Django girls</li>\n<li>Coding the NVIDIA jetbot (is Japan, of course, there were robots!)</li>\n<li>Introspective async io async await\nFor the full list of open-source projects, check <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNQsUUar-TD5AHfdDxupgjpdmvBF6Ao_wQ_lf5kJFjo/edit#gid=0\">this link</a> (sorry, is in Japanese).<br>\n<br /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though I consider myself to have a decent level of Japanese (let’s say I am able to have casual conversations) this wasn’t enough for me to get too confident of getting into a Japanese only project.</p>\n<p>Therefore I joined the introspective async io async await project called <a href=\"https://github.com/dimaqq/awaitwhat\">awaitwhat</a>. The main goal of the project was to get better tracebacks for asynchronous implementations. It was really funny to join this project and I was able to code with people from Taiwan, Japan and Finland.<br>\n<br /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PyCon JP 2019 Sprint day. 各テーブルで熱い議論がかわされています。<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconjp?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#pyconjp</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConJP?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PyConJP</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/piwxtt7FQm\">pic.twitter.com/piwxtt7FQm</a>\n— PyCon JP (@PyConJ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PyConJ/status/1172732447944953856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2019</a><br>\n<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was surprised that Taiwanese people are very open and friendly. Their event is part of the PyCon Asia tour and it is held with only a few weeks of difference from PyCon Japan. From this moment of my experience, I started feeling the cultural shock with Japan. Doing networking here is very challenging! Especially if you approach them in Japanese. The best advice I received from a Japanese roommate was:<br>\n<br /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Don’t use Japanese. Even if you can speak it, don’t use it. It will be more difficult for you to talk to them because of the Keigo (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese\">honorific speech</a> in Japanese). Just use English. Is easier”.<br>\n<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you don’t speak Japanese don’t be discouraged to come. In my perspective, Japanese people are harder to approach but once you overcome that barrier , they will make the best to have a good conversation with foreigners. Be prepared to use Google translator or any other Japanese-English dictionary application.</p>\n<p>The PyCon Sprint event ended with a huge python made of food. They did their best to take the shape of the animal. Hope you can see it from the picture.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/7f9e3/python_made_of_food.webp 256w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/1bb89/python_made_of_food.webp 512w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/53334/python_made_of_food.webp 1024w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/7e9e0/python_made_of_food.webp 1536w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/7c4f2/python_made_of_food.webp 2048w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/0b20a/python_made_of_food.webp 4096w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/11e76/python_made_of_food.jpg 256w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/a15fd/python_made_of_food.jpg 512w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/c3413/python_made_of_food.jpg 1024w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/c59e8/python_made_of_food.jpg 1536w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/8fe94/python_made_of_food.jpg 2048w,\n/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/6fadb/python_made_of_food.jpg 4096w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/36f7737d0e61b4c59816d4c68ee6b708/c3413/python_made_of_food.jpg\"\n          alt=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          title=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>First days of the conference</h3>\n<p>For the talks, I chose a combination of web-based talks and data science.

Hope you find them useful!</p>\n<h3>Wrapping up</h3>\n<p>Overall, PyCon Japan was a really good experience to live from the participant's point of view. If you don’t speak Japanese is quite challenging even though the conference team managed to somehow gather a balanced amount of English-Japanese talks. If you plan to come, my recommendation is to try to schedule also for PyCon Taiwan as well, because is very close and hey! Is a long journey for just staying a couple of days.</p>\n<p>One more thing that you should know is that at the end of the event, even the assistants helped with the cleaning of the main room. This is very common to see in Japanese culture where students help with the cleaning of their own classrooms or cleaning the place of a sports match. At that moment I didn’t had time to take a picture because I was busy helping :P</p>\n<br>\nではまた今度","rawMarkdownBody":"Coming to Japan for a technology conference has always been my dream since university. A lot of experience and learnings from cultural and technical aspects came from this. In this article, I will try to summarize my take aways as a developer and fan of the Japanese culture.\r\n\r\n### Development sprints\r\n\r\nMy experience started with the development sprints held at the center of Shibuya, one of the iconic areas inside Tokyo. As my first sprint, expectations were high and I couldn’t even gasper how will they be. There were a lot of proposed projects like:  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n* Making c wrappers for python\r\n* Code for Django girls\r\n* Coding the NVIDIA jetbot (is Japan, of course, there were robots!)\r\n* Introspective async io async await\r\nFor the full list of open-source projects, check [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNQsUUar-TD5AHfdDxupgjpdmvBF6Ao_wQ_lf5kJFjo/edit#gid=0) (sorry, is in Japanese).  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself to have a decent level of Japanese (let’s say I am able to have casual conversations) this wasn’t enough for me to get too confident of getting into a Japanese only project.\r\n\r\nTherefore I joined the introspective async io async await project called [awaitwhat](https://github.com/dimaqq/awaitwhat). The main goal of the project was to get better tracebacks for asynchronous implementations. It was really funny to join this project and I was able to code with people from Taiwan, Japan and Finland.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n> PyCon JP 2019 Sprint day. 各テーブルで熱い議論がかわされています。[#pyconjp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconjp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#PyConJP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConJP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/piwxtt7FQm](https://t.co/piwxtt7FQm)\r\n> — PyCon JP (@PyConJ) [September 14, 2019](https://twitter.com/PyConJ/status/1172732447944953856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nI was surprised that Taiwanese people are very open and friendly. Their event is part of the PyCon Asia tour and it is held with only a few weeks of difference from PyCon Japan. From this moment of my experience, I started feeling the cultural shock with Japan. Doing networking here is very challenging! Especially if you approach them in Japanese. The best advice I received from a Japanese roommate was:  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n> “Don’t use Japanese. Even if you can speak it, don’t use it. It will be more difficult for you to talk to them because of the Keigo ([honorific speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese) in Japanese). Just use English. Is easier”.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIf you don’t speak Japanese don’t be discouraged to come. In my perspective, Japanese people are harder to approach but once you overcome that barrier , they will make the best to have a good conversation with foreigners. Be prepared to use Google translator or any other Japanese-English dictionary application.\r\n\r\nThe PyCon Sprint event ended with a huge python made of food. They did their best to take the shape of the animal. Hope you can see it from the picture.\r\n\r\n![/sites/default/files/inline-images/keeptrack-dashboard-weknow.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/68519ea20ade07f7a2bbf4eea6cd9dad/python_made_of_food.jpg)\r\n\r\n### First days of the conference\r\n\r\nFor the talks, I chose a combination of web-based talks and data science. I think that’s the best that python can give to you, a wide range of topics where you can explore and grow your knowledge of what others are doing with the language.\r\n\r\n![.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/04f62ca42a53b2d1186ac30685296768/training_hands.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/04f62ca42a53b2d1186ac30685296768/training_hands.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe guys from Python Japan are doing a great work automating many of their tasks with the Slackbot, JIRA and G Suite API.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see how with only a few lines of code you can focus on the non-repetitive, analytical tasks when organizing an event. Interesting to notice how he managed his presentation focused on the motivations for doing the integrations. Most of the time we just jump aboard on a new technology or project without having a clear motivation behind.\r\n\r\n![.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/abf4df4cdf88b16a11d9e85b6f261392/slackbot_picture.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/abf4df4cdf88b16a11d9e85b6f261392/slackbot_picture.jpg)\r\n\r\nFor me, one of the best talks was the Pitch Detection Algorithm. I think the speaker manage the audience and his topic so well that anyone with no knowledge on the subject could understand what he was doing and its purpose. First time I hear of Fourier transforms outside the university!  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n> Speech recognition algorithm [#pyconjp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconjp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#tokyo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tokyo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#python](https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#DataScience](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScience?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/8Wr0y62CG2](https://t.co/8Wr0y62CG2)\r\n> — Javier Daza (@javidazac) [October 5, 2019](https://twitter.com/javidazac/status/1180321661549047808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nI think what captured my attention is that there was a huge space for showing projects with posters, where you had the chance to interact with the speaker and discuss relevant topics of their presentation.\r\n\r\nI have already been in PyCon Argentina and PyCon Colombia, and for me, this is a good opportunity for people who didn’t have the chance to qualify as speakers.\r\n\r\n![.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/717cfaedd55f20cb997209f4eec19a75/posters.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/717cfaedd55f20cb997209f4eec19a75/posters.jpg)\r\n\r\nOne thing that I found really cool while listening to the lightning talks was that the networking team of the conference made a report of how they managed to provide internet for 1000 people on the 2 days of conferences starting from day 0.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this only shows the level of commitment everyone has in Japan, that even the network team has their own poster, heatmap and presentation of their network infrastructure. Well done Japan!\r\n\r\n![.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/bf153f2f57a2df003fad4e2a26654aed/networking_talk.jpg](.cache/caches/gatsby-source-filesystem/bf153f2f57a2df003fad4e2a26654aed/networking_talk.jpg)\r\n\r\nHere are the links for the [PyCon Japan youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConJP/videos?view=2&sort=dd) and [presentation materials](https://pyconjp.connpass.com/event/135734/presentation/). Hope you find them useful!\r\n\r\n### Wrapping up\r\n\r\nOverall, PyCon Japan was a really good experience to live from the participant's point of view. If you don’t speak Japanese is quite challenging even though the conference team managed to somehow gather a balanced amount of English-Japanese talks. If you plan to come, my recommendation is to try to schedule also for PyCon Taiwan as well, because is very close and hey! Is a long journey for just staying a couple of days.\r\n\r\nOne more thing that you should know is that at the end of the event, even the assistants helped with the cleaning of the main room. This is very common to see in Japanese culture where students help with the cleaning of their own classrooms or cleaning the place of a sports match. At that moment I didn’t had time to take a picture because I was busy helping :P\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nではまた今度","excerpt":"Coming to Japan for a technology conference has always been my dream since university.

You can use this module to make sure Drupal JSON-API returns markdown to take advantage of as example the gatsby-transformer-remark plugin when using GatsbyJS. - [**Build Hooks**](https://www.drupal.org/project/build_hooks): This module allows you to trigger a build hook on any service provider that supports build hooks. This module mainly provides privileged users with a UI to Trigger deployments of the connected static site(s) at will, or automatically via cron or when an entity is modified. - [**JSON-API Extras**](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi_extras): This module provides zero-configuration out of the box. Use JSON:API Extras to customize your API. JSON:API Extras provides a means to override and provide limited configurations to the default zero-configuration implementation provided by the JSON:API module. - [**Gatsby Live Preview**](https://www.drupal.org/project/gatsby): This module provides support to live preview capabilities in Gatsby of Drupal content creation and edition. ### Where do I find this project?

Whenever we get a project, we always try to ensure that the end product is a smooth UX that comes with a convenient UI and an aesthetically pleasing website layout. Our weapon of choice is, of course, Gatsby and to that end we’re fairly obsessed with the static site generator owing to the superior quality that the generator offers.</p>\n<p>Gatsby balances out customizability without compromising website performance, which is simply brilliant. We try to contribute to the potential capabilities for Gatsby because we believe that Gatsby is the future of web development. For those who might be interested, we did a series of blogs where we spoke of the ways you can improve Gatsby-Drupal integration using <a href=\"https://weknowinc.com/blog/improving-drupal-and-gatsby-integration-gatsby-boina-starter\">Gatsby plug-ins</a> and <a href=\"https://weknowinc.com/blog/improving-drupal-and-gatsby-integration-drupal-modules\">modules</a> in Drupal, and how you can <a href=\"https://weknowinc.com/blog/how-create-text-markdown-node-process-content-using-gatsby\">create elements</a> to improve the performance of your Drupal websites.</p>\n<p>Just to drive the nail home, we feel that it’s important that you understand why Gatsby is so great and what exactly we mean when we say that it lets us create <strong>efficient</strong> websites. Clearly, there is a link between user preference and website performance; especially when you consider the <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-09-13-why-is-gatsby-so-fast/\">following statistics</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sites that load within 5 seconds have 25% higher ad viewership, 70% longer sessions and 35% lower bounce rates on average.</li>\n<li>53% of all mobile websites are abandoned if they take longer than 3 seconds to load.</li>\n<li>47% of all online shoppers expect a webpage to load within 2 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, it’s in your commercial interests to have websites that work really fast and which can load within a matter of seconds, because otherwise your customers/users will just lose interests. And if you can’t keep them around, you can’t expect to make sales or generate revenues. Your websites are the single most effective client base development tool at your disposal and you need these to run lightning fast.</p>\n<p>This entire discussion raises the question of <strong>how fast Gatsby really is.</strong> This is where we come to some important metrics for website performance measurements. We’ll assess how Gatsby websites measure across each of these to establish once and for all why Gatsby is a superior web development platform.</p>\n<h3>How Do Gatsby Websites Measure Up?</h3>\n<p>The people at Gatsby went through a lot of trouble to make sure that Gatsby websites turned out to be some of the fastest ever seen on the internet. For one thing, <a href=\"https://www.takeshape.io/articles/why-the-best-websites-are-static/\">static websites are typically faster</a>; owing to the fact that these weigh only a few kilobytes each, these render text faster and if you balance out your images to less than 1 MB in size, then these can run far faster than dynamic websites.</p>\n<p>Gatsby offers much more than just the advantages of a static website, it enhances website performance when compared to other static websites. The Gatsby website has <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-03-gatsby-perf/\">these metrics listed</a>, where they’ve measured various performance indicators that include:</p>\n<h3>Lower Time To Interactivity</h3>\n<p>Back in 2018, the average page load time for PC based websites across various industries was <a href=\"https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/\">around 9 seconds</a> and for those on mobile was 22 seconds. Considering how people move on from web pages if it doesn’t load within 15 seconds, that’s cutting it pretty close. The best way to keep people around is to give them something to interact with which is essentially tied to the time to load for your web pages.</p>\n<p>The time to interactivity is a measure of how soon the webpage is populated with interactive elements, which directly determines how soon the page will load and whether people will interact with it. Gatsby offers a time to interactive measurement of 1.62 seconds.</p>\n<h3>Lower Input Latency</h3>\n<p>Input latency, measured as a time to response resulting from a stimulus (Like clicking a link on the webpage) needs to be low because you don’t want to send ahead a laggy user experience. Gatsby websites measure at an average of 13 milliseconds. This is almost like the webpage is responding instantaneously to any inputs.</p>\n<h3>Higher Speed Indices</h3>\n<p>The speed index is a measure of how soon the visible elements of your website are displayed on the page. The lower the time, the faster your website displays content. Gatsby has a speed index of 810 milliseconds.</p>\n<h3>How Does Gatsby Manage These Numbers?</h3>\n<p>Gatsby is the latest in a line of static page generators each of which have been trying to ease the process of developing static websites and improving their performance. Before Gatsby came around, you could achieve the same results but you had to add plug-ins to make it happen. Gatsby already has many of these functionalities preinstalled and has made it far easier to manage your plug-ins to make development easier.</p>\n<p>However, this is part of why developing with Gatsby is easier. The reason for why Gatsby produces faster websites is because of the way it allows for the production of web pages. This process involves the following components:</p>\n<h3>Gatsby Uses PRPL</h3>\n<p>PRPL stands for Push, Render, Pre-Cache and Lazy Load. This basically implies that most of the page elements that the user will see have been pre-downloaded before they even ask for them and are just displayed instantaneously when the user clicks a certain link or scrolls down page. This pre-downloading is done in the background which is why it doesn’t affect of the performance of the webpage that the user is looking at currently.</p>\n<p><strong>Push:</strong>\nThis sends site assets essential for website functionality to the user before they’ve asked for any of these.</p>\n<p><strong>Render:</strong>\nThese assets are then used to render the basic layout for the page.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-Cache:</strong>\nOnce the user is on the website, it’s only inevitable that they will move around the website to follow various links. Gatsby websites download these pages to display them instantaneously; entire pages are downloaded irrespective of whether the user goes to them.

Whenever we get a project, we always try to ensure that the end product is a smooth UX that comes with a convenient UI and an aesthetically pleasing website layout. Our weapon of choice is, of course, Gatsby and to that end we’re fairly obsessed with the static site generator owing to the superior quality that the generator offers.\r\n\r\nGatsby balances out customizability without compromising website performance, which is simply brilliant. We try to contribute to the potential capabilities for Gatsby because we believe that Gatsby is the future of web development. For those who might be interested, we did a series of blogs where we spoke of the ways you can improve Gatsby-Drupal integration using [Gatsby plug-ins](https://weknowinc.com/blog/improving-drupal-and-gatsby-integration-gatsby-boina-starter) and [modules](https://weknowinc.com/blog/improving-drupal-and-gatsby-integration-drupal-modules) in Drupal, and how you can [create elements](https://weknowinc.com/blog/how-create-text-markdown-node-process-content-using-gatsby) to improve the performance of your Drupal websites.\r\n\r\nJust to drive the nail home, we feel that it’s important that you understand why Gatsby is so great and what exactly we mean when we say that it lets us create **efficient** websites. Clearly, there is a link between user preference and website performance; especially when you consider the [following statistics](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-09-13-why-is-gatsby-so-fast/):\r\n\r\n* Sites that load within 5 seconds have 25% higher ad viewership, 70% longer sessions and 35% lower bounce rates on average.\r\n* 53% of all mobile websites are abandoned if they take longer than 3 seconds to load.\r\n* 47% of all online shoppers expect a webpage to load within 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nClearly, it’s in your commercial interests to have websites that work really fast and which can load within a matter of seconds, because otherwise your customers/users will just lose interests. And if you can’t keep them around, you can’t expect to make sales or generate revenues. Your websites are the single most effective client base development tool at your disposal and you need these to run lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThis entire discussion raises the question of **how fast Gatsby really is.** This is where we come to some important metrics for website performance measurements. We’ll assess how Gatsby websites measure across each of these to establish once and for all why Gatsby is a superior web development platform.\r\n\r\n### How Do Gatsby Websites Measure Up?\r\n\r\nThe people at Gatsby went through a lot of trouble to make sure that Gatsby websites turned out to be some of the fastest ever seen on the internet. For one thing, [static websites are typically faster](https://www.takeshape.io/articles/why-the-best-websites-are-static/); owing to the fact that these weigh only a few kilobytes each, these render text faster and if you balance out your images to less than 1 MB in size, then these can run far faster than dynamic websites.\r\n\r\nGatsby offers much more than just the advantages of a static website, it enhances website performance when compared to other static websites. The Gatsby website has [these metrics listed](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-03-gatsby-perf/), where they’ve measured various performance indicators that include:\r\n\r\n### Lower Time To Interactivity\r\n\r\nBack in 2018, the average page load time for PC based websites across various industries was [around 9 seconds](https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/) and for those on mobile was 22 seconds. Considering how people move on from web pages if it doesn’t load within 15 seconds, that’s cutting it pretty close. The best way to keep people around is to give them something to interact with which is essentially tied to the time to load for your web pages.\r\n\r\nThe time to interactivity is a measure of how soon the webpage is populated with interactive elements, which directly determines how soon the page will load and whether people will interact with it. Gatsby offers a time to interactive measurement of 1.62 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Lower Input Latency\r\n\r\nInput latency, measured as a time to response resulting from a stimulus (Like clicking a link on the webpage) needs to be low because you don’t want to send ahead a laggy user experience. Gatsby websites measure at an average of 13 milliseconds. This is almost like the webpage is responding instantaneously to any inputs.\r\n\r\n### Higher Speed Indices\r\n\r\nThe speed index is a measure of how soon the visible elements of your website are displayed on the page. The lower the time, the faster your website displays content. Gatsby has a speed index of 810 milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### How Does Gatsby Manage These Numbers?\r\n\r\nGatsby is the latest in a line of static page generators each of which have been trying to ease the process of developing static websites and improving their performance. Before Gatsby came around, you could achieve the same results but you had to add plug-ins to make it happen. Gatsby already has many of these functionalities preinstalled and has made it far easier to manage your plug-ins to make development easier.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is part of why developing with Gatsby is easier. The reason for why Gatsby produces faster websites is because of the way it allows for the production of web pages. This process involves the following components:\r\n\r\n### Gatsby Uses PRPL\r\n\r\nPRPL stands for Push, Render, Pre-Cache and Lazy Load. This basically implies that most of the page elements that the user will see have been pre-downloaded before they even ask for them and are just displayed instantaneously when the user clicks a certain link or scrolls down page. This pre-downloading is done in the background which is why it doesn’t affect of the performance of the webpage that the user is looking at currently.\r\n\r\n**Push:**\r\nThis sends site assets essential for website functionality to the user before they’ve asked for any of these.\r\n\r\n**Render:**\r\nThese assets are then used to render the basic layout for the page.\r\n\r\n**Pre-Cache:**\r\nOnce the user is on the website, it’s only inevitable that they will move around the website to follow various links. Gatsby websites download these pages to display them instantaneously; entire pages are downloaded irrespective of whether the user goes to them. It’s a contingency that allows Gatsby to improve page load times.\r\n\r\n**Lazy-load:**\r\nAs the user scrolls down the page, all the hyperlinks are downloaded in the background to be shown whenever needed by the user.\r\n\r\n### Gatsby Uses In-Line CSS\r\n\r\nGatsby directly identifies the styles being used on the webpage, to present them as the page is being rendered. Compared to the conventional ways in which stylesheets are downloaded and then rendered; Gatsby renders the styles as the page is being rendered.\r\n\r\n### Gatsby Doesn’t Require Page Reloads\r\n\r\nWith Gatsby, the pre-downloaded web pages are instantaneously rendered when required; which doesn’t require a separate reload of a page each time you switch to a different one. It just links one pre-cached page to a link and then renders it as is required.\r\n\r\n### Gatsby Uses Data Splitting\r\n\r\nGatsby only sends ahead the code required for any page to render instead of all the code which is then periodically parsed as required. This shaves milliseconds from the page load times.\r\n\r\n### Gatsby Pre-Fetches Data\r\n\r\nSince Gatsby doesn’t download content/code from links only when required; instead pre-downloading it, the websites work far faster than they would through other development tools.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gatsby essential pre-prepares and pre-fetches data to be viewed as required by the user. Since a browser’s cache already contains these pages, there is no need to download these pages again. With some shrewd delegation of computing processes and truncating redundant or unnecessary computing processes; Gatsby delivers a user experience that is changing website development as we speak.","excerpt":"At weKnow, we’re all about making the best user experiences for our clients.
